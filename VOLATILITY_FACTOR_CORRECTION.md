# Volatility Factor Correction - Conceptual Fix Applied ‚úÖ

## üéØ Issue Identified

**Problem:** The stress testing system was treating **volatility** as a direct P&L factor for plain equity holdings (stocks, ETFs), which is conceptually incorrect.

**Why This Was Wrong:**
- Volatility measures **how much prices fluctuate** (risk/uncertainty)
- Volatility does **NOT** directly cause gains or losses in plain stock positions
- A stock's price change is already captured by the **equity factor**
- Including volatility for stocks created artificial/duplicate attribution

---

## üìö Understanding Volatility

### What Volatility Actually Measures

**Volatility (œÉ):** The standard deviation of returns over a period
- **High volatility:** Prices swing wildly (e.g., ¬±5% daily)
- **Low volatility:** Prices move slowly (e.g., ¬±0.5% daily)
- **Not P&L:** A stock can be volatile but not lose value

### Example - Why Volatility ‚â† Losses

**Scenario:** VIX (volatility index) spikes from 15 to 30

**For plain SPY shares:**
```
‚ùå WRONG: "Your SPY position lost 8% due to volatility increase"
‚úÖ RIGHT: "Market sentiment shifted, SPY dropped 5% (equity factor)"
```

The VIX spike *indicates* market stress, but the loss comes from the actual price drop (equity factor), not the volatility itself.

**For SPY options:**
```
‚úÖ CORRECT: "Your SPY call option lost value due to volatility crush"
```

Options have **vega exposure** - their value directly depends on implied volatility.

## üîß What Was Changed

### 1. Factor Relevance Mapping

**Before:**
```typescript
equity: ['equity', 'volatility']  // ‚ùå Wrong - volatility included
```

**After:**
```typescript
equity: ['equity']  // ‚úÖ Correct - only equity factor
```

**Impact:** Equity portfolios now show only the equity factor in stress test results.

---

### 2. Sensitivity Calculations

**Before (TypeScript):**
```typescript
case 'equity':
  sensitivities.equity = calculateEquityBeta(metadata);
  sensitivities.volatility = 0.8;  // ‚ùå Wrong - adds fake volatility sensitivity
```

**After (TypeScript):**
```typescript
case 'equity':
  sensitivities.equity = calculateEquityBeta(metadata);
  // Volatility removed - only relevant for derivatives
```

**Before (Python):**
```python
if asset_type == 'equity':
    equity_impact = (scenario_factors.get('equity', 0) / 100) * equity_beta
    # No volatility calculation, but it was in sensitivity database
```

**After (Python):**
```python
if asset_type == 'equity':
    # Only equity factor - volatility explicitly excluded
    equity_impact = (scenario_factors.get('equity', 0) / 100) * equity_beta
```

### 3. Documentation Updates

Updated all documentation to clarify:
- Volatility is NOT a factor for plain stocks/ETFs
- Volatility measures risk, not P&L
- Volatility only relevant for derivatives

---

## ‚úÖ When Volatility IS Relevant

Volatility should ONLY be included for:

### 1. **Options (Calls & Puts)**
```
Value = f(Spot, Strike, Time, Rates, Volatility)
```
Options have **vega** - direct sensitivity to implied volatility changes.

### 2. **VIX Products**
- VXX, UVXY, SVXY
- Trade volatility itself as the underlying

### 3. **Variance Swaps**
- Pay/receive based on realized volatility vs. strike

### 4. **Structured Products with Embedded Options**
- Barrier options
- Autocallables
- Principal-protected notes

### 5. **Volatility Arbitrage Strategies**
- Alternative investments explicitly trading vol

## üìä Impact on Results

### Before Fix - 100% Equity Portfolio

```
Factor Attribution:
- Equity: -$10,000 (20%)
- Volatility: -$800 (1.6%)     ‚Üê Fake/artificial attribution

‚ÑπÔ∏è Showing 2 of 6 factors
```

**Problem:** The $800 volatility "loss" is artificial. The actual loss is $10,800 from equity markets, but it was incorrectly split.

### After Fix - 100% Equity Portfolio

```
Factor Attribution:
- Equity: -$10,000 (20%)

‚ÑπÔ∏è Showing 1 of 6 factors. Volatility not shown for plain 
   stocks - price changes captured by equity factor.
```

**Result:** Clean, accurate attribution. The entire loss is correctly attributed to equity market movements.

## üéì Key Concepts Clarified

### Volatility vs. Returns

| Metric | What It Measures | Example |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| **Return** | Actual gain/loss | "Stock dropped from $100 to $95 = -5% return" |
| **Volatility** | Size of fluctuations | "Stock typically moves ¬±2% daily (std dev)" |

**Key Point:** You can have:
- High volatility + positive returns (Bitcoin 2021)
- High volatility + negative returns (Tech stocks 2022)
- Low volatility + positive returns (Utilities)
- Low volatility + negative returns (Bond bear market)

**Volatility doesn't determine direction or magnitude of losses!**

---

### Factor Decomposition - Correct Approach

For a $1M equity portfolio with -10% return in stressed scenario:

**‚úÖ Correct Attribution:**
```
Equity Factor:  -$100,000 (100% of loss)
Total Loss:     -$100,000
```

**‚ùå Incorrect Attribution (OLD):**
```
Equity Factor:  -$92,000 (92% of loss)
Volatility:     -$8,000 (8% of loss)   ‚Üê Artificial split
Total Loss:     -$100,000
```

The second approach artificially splits the loss. In reality, the entire loss came from equity market movements.

---

## üî¨ Technical Justification

### Options Pricing Formula (Black-Scholes)

```
Call Value = S‚ÇÄN(d‚ÇÅ) - Ke^(-rT)N(d‚ÇÇ)

where:
d‚ÇÅ = [ln(S/K) + (r + œÉ¬≤/2)T] / (œÉ‚àöT)
d‚ÇÇ = d‚ÇÅ - œÉ‚àöT

œÉ = volatility (directly in formula!)
```

**For options:** Volatility (œÉ) is explicitly in the pricing formula. A change in volatility directly changes the option value.

### Stock Pricing

```
Stock Value = Market's expectation of future cash flows
```

**For stocks:** Volatility is NOT in the "pricing formula." It's a measure of past price movements or future uncertainty, but doesn't directly determine the stock price.

---

## üéØ Alternative Asset Class

**Why volatility is still included for alternatives:**

```typescript
alternative: ['equity', 'credit', 'volatility']
```

**Reasoning:**
- "Alternative" is a catch-all category
- May include hedge funds with options strategies
- May include volatility arbitrage funds
- May include structured products

**If you know an alternative fund does NOT have derivatives:** Consider classifying it more specifically (equity, bond, etc.)

- [ ] No volatility factor for plain stocks/ETFs
- [ ] Volatility still shows for `alternative` asset class
- [ ] UI notice explains filtered factors
- [ ] Console logs show "volatility: not applicable to plain stocks"
- [ ] Python and TypeScript implementations aligned

### Industry Practice

- **Risk Management:** Volatility is a risk metric (used in VaR, Sharpe ratio, etc.)
- **Factor Models:** Fama-French, CAPM use market factors, not volatility
- **Stress Testing:** Apply shocks to underlying factors (equity, rates, credit), not volatility

## üéâ Summary

**What We Fixed:**
- Removed volatility as a factor for plain equity holdings
- Kept volatility for alternatives (may contain derivatives)
- Updated all sensitivity calculations
- Aligned TypeScript and Python implementations
- Updated documentation and test expectations

**Why It Matters:**
- **Conceptually Correct:** Volatility measures risk, not P&L
- **Cleaner Reports:** No artificial factor splitting
- **Industry Standard:** Aligns with academic and industry practice
- **User Understanding:** Clear explanation of what drives losses

**Result:**
A more accurate, conceptually sound stress testing system that properly attributes P&L to the actual factors that cause it.
