## üì± User Experience Flow

1. **User sees stress test results** with various percentages and impacts
2. **User taps ‚ÑπÔ∏è icon** next to any calculation they want to understand
3. **Modal appears** with detailed explanation including:
   - **Summary**: Plain English explanation of what the number means
   - **Formula**: Mathematical formula used
   - **Example**: Real calculation with actual numbers
   - **Breakdown**: Step-by-step component breakdown
4. **User taps "Got it"** to dismiss and continue

## üßÆ Example Explanations

### For AAPL -28.50% Impact:
```
Title: "How AAPL Impact is Calculated"

Summary: "AAPL has an equity beta of 1.14, which means it typically moves 14% more than the overall market. In this -25% market scenario, AAPL is expected to move by -28.50%."

Formula: "Asset Impact = Market Shock √ó Asset Beta"

Example: "-25% √ó 1.14 = -28.50%"

Breakdown:
‚Ä¢ Asset: AAPL
‚Ä¢ Asset Type: equity
‚Ä¢ Sector: Technology
‚Ä¢ Market Cap: large
‚Ä¢ Calculated Beta: 1.14
‚Ä¢ Current Value: $10,000
‚Ä¢ Stressed Value: $7,150
‚Ä¢ Impact: -28.50%
```

### For Portfolio Beta Calculation:
```
Title: "How Beta is Calculated"

Summary: "Beta measures how much an asset moves relative to the market. AAPL has a beta of 1.14, meaning it typically moves 14% more than the overall market."

Formula: "Beta = Base √ó Market Cap √ó Sector √ó Geography"

Example: "1.0 √ó 0.95 √ó 1.2 √ó 1.0 = 1.14"

Breakdown:
‚Ä¢ Base Beta: 1.0 (market baseline)
‚Ä¢ Market Cap Adjustment: 0.95 (large cap)
‚Ä¢ Sector Adjustment: 1.2 (Technology)
‚Ä¢ Geography Adjustment: 1.0 (US)
‚Ä¢ Final Beta: 1.14
```
