### 2. Update Configuration with Real Values üìù

Once your Apple Developer account is active, update these placeholder values:

#### In `app.json`:
```json
"apiBase": "https://your-production-api.com"  // Replace with your real production API URL
"stressBase": "https://your-production-api.com"  // Replace with your real production API URL
```

#### In `eas.json`:
```json
"appleId": "your-apple-id@example.com",  // Replace with your Apple ID
"ascAppId": "your-app-store-connect-app-id",  // Get from App Store Connect
"appleTeamId": "your-apple-team-id"  // Get from Apple Developer Portal
```

### 3. Create App in App Store Connect üöÄ
